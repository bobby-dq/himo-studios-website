                <h2>1. Simple Navigation</h2>
                <p>Nothing is more frustrating than visiting a website with highly complex navigation, and it is very easy to lose a potential customer due to a confusing navigation bar. </p>
                <p>It is important that navigation through your website as easy as possible for your visitors, no matter what type of navigation you choose. Your navigation should be concise, simple, straightforward, seamless, and intuitive. </p>

                <h2>2. Clear and Compelling Calls to Action</h2>
                <p>The biggest goal of your website is to make your customers do something, and that is totally up to you. It could be contacting you, purchasing your service, claiming a free trial, signing up for your newsletter,  or consultation - the possibilities are endless.</p>
                <p>Each business and website are different; therefore, each goal is different from the other. But it is important to have a clear strategy revolving around the call to action to convert as many visitors to clients.</p>
                <p>Your visitors must never be confused about what to do, so your call to action should be clear, catchy, and strategically placed all over your website. </p>

                <h2>3. Mobile Responsiveness</h2>
                <p>Here is a quick fact - more than 60 percent of internet users access online content through their mobile devices. Let that sink in for a bit, and realize what that means for you. It means that not only does your website needs to be accessible on mobile, but also mobile responsive. Meaning its content and information rearranges themselves according to screen size.</p>
                <p>As of April 2015, mobile responsiveness is now included in Google's SEO algorithm. So if your website is not mobile responsive, your website will not show up in search results as much as you want it to be.</p>

                <h2>4. An Effective Domain Name</h2>
                <p>Your domain name is your website's address in the vast world of the web. Your domain name is what people type in the browser to visit your website; therefore, it is ideal that your domain name reflects your company.</p>
                <p>Investing in a few dollars a month for a custom domain name tells you that you're website, and ultimately your company is trustworthy.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of domain name registrars that can provide you custom domain names such as NameCheap and GoDaddy. Ideally, your domain name should not be more than three words so that visitors and potential customers can easily make sense of it and remember it.</p>

                <h2>5. Define A Clear Purpose</h2>
                <p>You know what your company provides, and so should everyone that visits your website. When someone lands on your site, three things should be evident on the homepage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What you provide</li>
                    <li>How can a visitor purchase/receive your services</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's crucial to familiarize visitors with your purpose to either persuade them or assure them that they're visiting the right website.</p>

                <h2>6. Appealing Visual Design</h2>
                <p>An outdated and unattractive website design can quickly turn off visitors and cause them to leave your website eventually. Professional and artistic visuals are often the first thing that catches the attention of the visitor.</p>
                <p>Distracting and hard-to-read text, and clashing colors is a sign of outdated design. Your website is your most significant employee and business asset; therefore, it is essential to keep up with a modern design and not miss out on evolving web development technologies to make your website as powerful as possible.</p>

                <h2>7. Your Contact Information Should be Easy To Locate</h2>
                <p>This is a necessity. If a potential customer visits your website, your contact information should be readily available if they have any inquiries or questions. </p>
                <p>It is vital to provide them your contact information such as phone number, email address, and social media links.</p>
                <p>It also helps to have a contact form on your website where visitors can fill out their contact information with a quick inquiry message alongside it. Don't make it hard for them by sending them on a wild goose chase.</p>

                <p>This list only scratches the surface of excellent website design but is enough for your website to stand out and convert visitors. A well-designed and optimized website creates trust, enhance professionalism, grab attention, grow credibility and grow your business.
