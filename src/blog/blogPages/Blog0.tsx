                    Every modern business has a website, and rightfully so.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
                <p>You must keep in mind the primary purpose of creating your website. Is it to make sales? Get client leads? Get email newsletter subscribers? Or to increase engagement? Whatever it may be, you must keep this in mind to design your website accordingly.</p>

        </div>
    );
