                    Every modern business has a website, and rightfully so. Almost everybody checks a business's website before performing business with them, and this means that your website needs to be effective in converting visitors to customers. Here is a checklist that Himo Studios follows in creating a professional and well-designed website:
                </p>  
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
                <p>You must keep in mind the primary purpose of creating your website. Is it to make sales? Get client leads? Get email newsletter subscribers? Or to increase engagement? Whatever it may be, you must keep this in mind to design your website accordingly.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>2. Target Audience</h2>
                <p>This is overlooked quite a bit. When creating your website, you must ask the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who is the user?</li>
                    <li>What are their interests?</li>
                    <li>What are their main goals?</li>
                </ul>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>3. Strategy</h2>
                <p>With both your website purpose and target audience realized, research each subject and let that be the main focus of your website design and architecture.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>4. Website Style and Perception</h2>
                <p>Tailor your website according to your target audience. Keep in mind that "Glam and Glamour Makeup" is totally different from "McKafee Legal Consultation."</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>5. Layout/Wireframing</h2>
                <p>Having a pre-determined layout/wireframe will make your life easier. Resources such as Figma or Adobe Xd are great resources in wireframing. However, don't overcomplicate this and keep it simple, don't spend too much time wireframing - it's only a quick layout and overview of the final design.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>6. Color Theme</h2>
                <p>Pick the right color palette for the services you provide. If you provide cleaning services, brown earth tones might send the wrong message.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>7. Typography</h2>
                <p>Font styles can significantly affect how visitors perceive your website. If you want a classy or professional look, use simple and clean fonts. If you want a relaxed or creative look, use styled or handwritten fonts. </p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>8. Images and Icons</h2>
                <p>Well, as it stands, pictures are worth a thousand words. Carefully picked images can create a huge impact. People are visual, and websites are visual marketing, so use striking images and icons.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>9. Code</h2>
                <p>Figure out which web development technology stack you're going to use. Are you going to use WordPress? JavaSript? HTML and CSS? Does your website require a backend as well? These are questions you must ask yourself before you start coding.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>10. Outsource</h2>
                <p>If there are certain aspects in your website or online branding you cannot do, don't be afraid to outsource. There are many great creators and freelancers out there. Fiverr and UpWork are just a few places where you can look for them.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>11. Content</h2>
                <p>Engage the user with relevant content. The content you have on your website should align with your business goals and try to make your content as SEO-friendly as possible.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>12. SEO</h2>
                <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential for your website to show up as high as possible on search engine result pages (Google). This can be optimized in your title, meta tags, URL, keywords, internal/external links, etc.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>13. Tiny Details</h2>
                <p>Don't forget about the small things such as Disclaimers and Social Links.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>14. Contingency Plan</h2>
                <p>In case your website crashes or shuts down, have a temporary backup plan. Ensure that you keep the traffic flowing while your developers fix the issues.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>15. Backups</h2>
                <p>Data is essential in well-optimized websites and marketing. Ensure that you set up automated backups or regular manual backups.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>16. Browser Compatibilty</h2>
                <p>Does your website look good on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer? Ensure that your CSS is compatible with all browsers.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>17. Testing</h2>
                <p>Test and check for any grammar errors and bugs. Run site spiders to check for 404's and test all the funnels for errors.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>18. Security</h2>
                <p>Secure your website with the relevant tools. Store your passwords in secure databases, set up firewalls, and make your website HTTPS. HTTPS prevents websites from having their information broadcast in a way that's easily viewed by anyone snooping on the network.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>19. Make the Website Live</h2>
                <p>Host your website using hosting services such as Azure, Linode, AWS, Digital Ocean, and more! Also, make sure to invest in custom domain names - Namecheap and GoDaddy are just a couple of trustworthy domain registrars.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <h2>20. Marketing</h2>
                <p>This is the most crucial part - targeted traffic. SEO, regularly post blogs, engage in social media, and start an ad campaign are essential in keeping high traffic on your website.</p>
            </SDiv>
            <SDiv>
                <p>That's a quick list Himo Studios go through when creating websites for our clients!</p>
